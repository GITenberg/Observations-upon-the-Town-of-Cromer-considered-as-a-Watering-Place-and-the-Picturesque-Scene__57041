<h2><a name="pageiii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
iii</span>Preface.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Bathing</span> places being generally
resorted to during the summer season, for the different pursuits
either of health or pleasure, I have often wondered that some
little account of such as are not so much esteemed as Weymouth,
Brighthelmstone and Ramsgate, should not be published; and more
particularly where the situation of the place itself, and the
scenery of the country around, are not entirely destitute of
beauty.</p>
<p>These considerations, added to a residence on the spot, first
induced me, for my private amusement, to consider Cromer and the
scenery in its neighbourhood in a picturesque <a
name="pageiv"></a><span class="pagenum">p. iv</span>point of
view.&nbsp; My profession, that of a Surgeon, leading me daily to
one or other of the scenes here described, is certainly an
advantage, as the features of landscape appear extremely
different accordingly as they are affected by difference of
weather, of lights and shadows, and of morning and evening
suns.</p>
<p>In watering places where there are neither public rooms nor
assemblies, walking and riding become the chief sources of
amusement; and for invalids it is more particularly necessary to
divert the attention, by pointing put those things which are
esteemed most worthy of observation.&nbsp; Few people are
altogether insensible to the beauties of a fine
country,&mdash;few things to a contemplative mind are capable of
giving that satisfaction which the beauties of nature will
afford.</p>
<p>By the same rule, also, gentlemen&rsquo;s seats, which are
often the repositories of the works of art, produce ample
speculation for the artist and virtuoso.</p>
<p><a name="pagev"></a><span class="pagenum">p. v</span>In
visiting small, and I may be allowed to say, obscure
watering-places, retirement seems to be the principal
object.&nbsp; Where bathing only is the inducement, the place and
its neighbourhood is of very little consequence, provided it is
convenient and near the sea; but where the mind and body are
capable of being sufficiently active to be amused abroad, or to
those whose aim is pleasure, a country affording that amusement
by its variety, is certainly to be preferred; and to such as are
fond of the study of landscape, variety and some degree of beauty
are absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>As every little excursion will begin and end at Cromer, each
will be formed into a separate section.&nbsp; I have before said
that this undertaking was at first intended solely for my own
amusement, and with that idea I had sketched several views, but
after I had come to a determination to hazard its entrance into
the world, I found it necessary to confine myself to one only, on
account of the additional price they would have put upon the
publication.</p>
<p><a name="pagevi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. vi</span>After
the excellent things which have been produced in this way, by the
Rev. Mr. Gilpin, there is certainly great temerity in attempting,
even for private amusement, any thing which bears the most
distant resemblance to such elegant productions.&nbsp; From which
consideration, I cannot here omit to solicit the indulgence of
the public for the ensuing pages, which are intended only as
humble imitators, not as daring rivals of that excellent
master.</p>

1</span>CROMER.</h2>
<h3><i>Section the First</i>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> town of CROMER is situated on
the north-east part of the county of Norfolk, upon the edge of
the british ocean, from which it is defended by cliffs of
considerable height.</p>
<p>It must formerly have been a place of much more consequence
than it is at present, as that which is now called Cromer, was in
the survey made by the Conqueror, accounted for under the town
and lordship of Shipdon, which has long given way to the
encroachments of the sea, together with the parish church
dedicated to Saint Peter.</p>
<p><a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>At low
water there are many large masses of old wall to be seen, which
appear evidently to have belonged to some of the buildings of the
old town; and at very low tides a piece of building is
discoverable, which the fishermen call the Church Rock, it being
generally supposed to have been a part of the old church of
Shipdon, and I think with some probability of truth; though
others have doubted it, supposing it impossible but that the
constant action of the sea for so many ages, must long ere this
have dissolved all traces of it.</p>
<p>The present church, dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul,
was probably erected in the time of Henry the fourth.&nbsp; It is
a very handsome pile, built with flint and freestone, consisting
of a body and two aisles, covered with slate; the tower, which is
square, with an embattled top, is an hundred and fifty-nine feet
in height.</p>
<p>The entrance at the west end, is a beautiful specimen of
gothic architecture, now in ruins; as is the porch on the north
side and the chancel.&nbsp; <a name="page3"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 3</span>The flinting in many parts of the
building, for the beauty of its execution, is, perhaps, scarcely
any where to be excelled.</p>
<p>The inside of the church, which is kept in good repair, is
capable of containing a very great number of persons; it is also
tolerably well pewed; but except the double row of arches which
support the roof and divide the aisles, very little of what it
has been remains; these, however, are of beautiful proportions,
and the windows which were formerly of noble dimensions, and
probably ornamented with that most elegant of church-decorations,
painted glass, are now in a great measure closed up by the hands
of the bricklayer.</p>
<p>Amongst the repairs done to the church is one, which though it
may be, and certainly is, in some measure beneficial, yet, as it
affects the beautiful proportions of the middle aisle, the eye of
taste must regret&mdash;I mean the flat ceiling, which diminishes
the height of the building by cutting off the roof.&nbsp; Height
when duly proportioned <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>proportioned certainly adds much to
grandeur.&nbsp; In churches and in most gothic buildings the roof
terminates in a point corresponding with the other parts, and by
the exclusion of which the proportion and beauty of the building
is in a great measure destroyed.</p>
<p>There is something too in the dark and sombre hue of the roofs
of churches, when the timbers are left in their original state,
that is very pleasing.</p>
<p>Monuments there are none of any consequence,&mdash;one or two
of the Windham and Ditchell families are all the church contains;
but a well-toned organ has been placed in the gallery within
these few years, for which the church is peculiarly adapted.</p>
<p>At about a third part of the height of the staircase, which
leads up the steeple, is a door which opens upon the lead of a
small turret, communicating with the stairs, from which a few
years since, a boy, by the name of Yaxley, <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>fell into the
church yard, between some timbers which were laid there for the
repairs of the church, without receiving any other hurt than a
few slight bruises, and is now on board a ship in his
Majesty&rsquo;s service.</p>
<p>Robert Bacon, a mariner, of Cromer, (says the History of
Norfolk) found out Iceland, and is said to have taken the Prince
of Scotland, James Stewart, sailing to France for education, in
the time of Henry the fourth.</p>
<p>By the will of Sir Bartholomew Rede, citizen and goldsmith,
also an alderman of London, made in October, 1505, in the
twenty-first of Henry the seventh, the annual sum of ten pounds
was bequeathed for the foundation of a free grammar-school, which
is paid to the master by the goldsmith&rsquo;s company.</p>
<p>The houses in general are indifferent and the rents very high;
yet tolerable accommodation is to be found for strangers, from
one to three guineas per week, some of which command <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>a fine view of
the sea, and are extremely desirable.</p>
<p>The want of a large and well-conducted Inn is amongst those
few things which are chiefly to be regretted by those who pay a
visit to Cromer.&nbsp; Parties are frequently formed for an
excursion to a watering place by those who have neither time, nor
inclination, to stay sufficiently long to make it worth their
while to engage lodgings; of course they complain of the want of
accommodation.&nbsp; The consequence is, they become disgusted
with the place, and not unfrequently, I fear, leave it with a
determination of coming no more, but also by describing to others
the inconveniences they have experienced, deter them from making
trial of a place where their neighbours have fared so
indifferently.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the trade to an Inn-keeper (in this and I
suppose, indeed, it is the same in most small bathing places) is
almost entirely confined to the summer season; therefore, unless
the influx of company at that time was <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>sufficient to carry him through the
expences of the winter also, I very much fear such an Inn as is
necessary for the situation could not answer.&nbsp; However, I
should think the trial of it, though hazardous, might probably
prove successful: with such an addition, Cromer would, perhaps,
in the course of a few years, stand a chance of rivalling some of
the more celebrated bathing places for the number, as well as
consequence of its visitors; without it, it must to a certainty
remain contented with its present acquisitions.</p>
<p>Lobsters, crabs, whitings, cod-fish and herrings, are all
caught here in the finest perfection; the former are always
eagerly sought after by all who arrive; indeed, coming to Cromer
and eating lobsters are things nearly synonymous.</p>
<p>The lower class of people are chiefly supported by fishing;
the herrings which are caught here are cured in the town, a house
within three or four years having been erected for that purpose,
which, I believe, answers well <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>both to the proprietor and the
fishermen, who now find an immediate market for any quantity they
may bring in.</p>
<p>The fishery, independent of the pleasure we receive from the
consideration of the support it brings to a numerous, hardy, and
in many instances, an industrious set of people, is not without
its effect in a picturesque point of view.&nbsp; The different
preparations for a voyage; the groupes of figures employed in
different ways,&mdash;some carrying a boat down to the
water&rsquo;s edge,&mdash;some carrying nets, oars, masts and
sails; while others, in a greater state of forwardness are
actually pulling through the breakers, form a scene of the most
busy, various and pleasing kind.</p>
<p>The return, also, of the fishermen from this little voyage,
frequently affords a scene truly interesting; particularly in the
herring season, which being in the autumnal equinox, is liable to
wind, which sometimes suddenly bringing a considerable swell upon
the beach, renders the <a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>coming in of the boats both difficult
and dangerous; a circumstance which although it cannot fail in a
great measure to take from the pleasure we should experience in
being witness to such a scene unconnected with danger, yet the
different attitudes of the boat as it is impelled over the
billows, the exertions of the crew, the agitation of the water,
and the expression marked in the countenances of the surrounding
spectators awaiting their arrival&mdash;are all of them incidents
so highly picturesque, that we can but behold them with
admiration.</p>
<p>At one moment the little bark followed by a mountain of a sea
hanging over its stern, every instant menacing
destruction&mdash;the next thrown up aloft, ready to be
precipitated into the gaping gulph below; alternately keeping the
spectators and crew, trembling between fear and hope, till at
last some friendly wave with dreadful force hurls it upon the
shore. <a name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a></p>
<p><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>Those
faces (for upon such occasions the beach is always covered with
beholders) which were but the moment before the most strongly
expressive of the feelings of wife, mother, children or friend,
under the most torturing anxiety <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>for the safety of those who are most
nearly allied to them, by the ties of affection or of interest,
are in an instant changed to smiles and tears of joy, to thanks
for their safety, and almost in the same breath to enquiries
about the success of the voyage.</p>
<p>The mercantile trade here is small; the want of a convenient
harbour where ships might ride in safety, will ever be an
obstacle; there are, however, small exports of corn and imports
of coal, tiles, oil cake, London porter, &amp;c.</p>
<p>Perhaps there are few places, even at the distance of twenty
miles from the sea, where coals are dearer than they are here;
one principal reason of which is, the expence and hazard
attending the unloading; to effect which the vessel is laid upon
the beach at high water (which can only be done in fine weather)
and when the tide is sufficiently ebbed, the coals are taken from
the vessel by carts, each carrying half a chaldron, which is as
much as four horses can well get up the steep and sandy road cut
through the cliff.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>Thus
the business is carried on till the returning tide obliges them
to desist till the next ebb.&nbsp; About two tides generally
serve to complete the ship&rsquo;s unloading, which is seldom of
greater burthen than from sixty to seventy tons.</p>
<p>From the loading and unloading the vessels arises another
source of picturesque amusement from the combination of horses
and carts, men and boys&mdash;these employed in their different
departments compose various groupes, and give a new character to
the scene, by connecting maritime with rural occupations.</p>
<p>There are no places of public amusement, no rooms, balls, nor
card assemblies.&nbsp; A small circulating library, consisting
chiefly of a few novels, is all that can be obtained; but still
for such as make retirement their aim, it is certainly an
eligible situation.</p>
<p>The bathing machines are very commodious, and the bather a
careful, attentive man.&nbsp; The shore, also, which is a fine
firm sand, not only <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>only renders the bathing agreeable, but when the tide
retires, presents such a surface for many miles as cannot be
exceeded.&nbsp; The sea too is one of those objects that appears
to have the constant power of pleasing.&nbsp; Other scenes
(though beautiful in themselves) by being seen constantly, either
lose much of their power or become tiresome by their
sameness;&mdash;it is not so with the sea&mdash;those who live
constantly by the side of it, if their occupation lies within
doors, seldom fail at the leisure hour of noon or eve, to pay
their respects to it, even in the most stormy weather.&nbsp; This
fondness can arise from no other source than the constant variety
it produces.&nbsp; Its charms are various and
incessant&mdash;whether its azure surface is dressed in smiles or
irritated into frowns by the surly northern or eastern blast.</p>
<p>The cliffs in many parts are lofty and well broken, and their
feet being for the most part composed of strong blue clay, are
capable of making considerable resistance to the impetuous
attacks of the sea; so that when the upper parts <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>which are of
a looser texture are brought down by springs, frosts or other
accidental circumstances, and are carried away by the action of
the tide, the feet still remain, opposing their bold projections
to the fury of the storm.</p>
<p>It is very rare too, that there is a scarcity of shipping to
adorn the scene; the trade from Newcastle, Sunderland and the
Baltic, keeping up a constant succession.&nbsp; The different
parties of pleasure, also, that assemble upon the beach in an
evening, for walking, riding or reading, constitute variety and
make it a very pleasant resort.&nbsp; But towards the close of a
fine summer&rsquo;s evening, when the sun declining in full
splendour, tinting the whole scene with a golding glow, the sea
shore becomes an object truly sublime.&nbsp; The noble expanse of
blue waters on the one hand, the distant sail catching the last
rays of the setting sun, controlled on the other by the rugged
surfaces of the impending cliffs, the stillness of the scene,
interrupted only by the gentle murmurs of the waves falling at
your feet or perhaps by the <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>solemn dashing of oars, or at
intervals, by the hoarse bawling of the
seamen;&mdash;&ldquo;music in such full unison&rdquo; with the
surrounding objects and altogether calculated to inspire so
pleasing a train of thoughts to the contemplative, solitary
stroller, that he does not awake from his reverie till</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;black
and deep the night begins to fall.<br />
A shade immense, sunk in the quenching gloom;<br />
Magnificent and vast, are Heaven and earth.<br />
Order confounded lies; all beauty void;<br />
Distinction lost; and gay variety<br />
One universal blot; such the fair power<br />
Of Light, to kindle and create the whole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What can give a more adequate idea of the power of the divine
Creator than such a scene?&nbsp; What can give a fuller
comprehension of the compass of human invention than the
intercourse which is maintained between nations through the
medium of navigation?&nbsp; And to an Englishman can there be a
more pleasing or exulting theme, than the wide extent of the <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>commerce of
Great Britain and the glory of the British Navy?&mdash;the
bulwark of this happy land.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;This royal throne of Kings, this
scepter&rsquo;d Isle,<br />
This earth of Majesty, this seat of Mars,<br />
This other Eden, demy Paradise,<br />
This fortress built by Nature for herself,<br />
Against infection and the hand of war;<br />
This happy breed of men, this little world,<br />
This precious stone set in the silver sea,<br />
Which serves it in the office of a wall,<br />
Or as a moat defensive to a house,<br />
Against the envy of less happier lands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the artist, also, the sea furnishes an almost never-ending
source of amusement; it is a constant moving picture capable of a
thousand modifications, and of being treated on canvass in
various ways; it admits too of the grandest effects of light and
shadow, and in the hands of such a master as Vanderveldt of
producing wonderful effect.&nbsp; But it is in the storm alone
that the grand effects I am speaking of are to be found.</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry"><a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>&ldquo;When
huge uproar lords it wide&rdquo;</p>
<p>It wants at such times no adventitious aids to set it
off.&nbsp; The calm on the contrary without some assistance, as
rocks, fortifications or figures, will hardly be able to support
itself.&nbsp; It is true you may place a vessel in the
fore-ground, but a ship at anchor lying with her whole broadside
to the eye, however noble it may be to contemplate or pleasing by
the goodness of the painting, will always be a formal
object.&nbsp; If you wish to make it picturesque you must compose
your fore-ground of some projecting rock, or pier-head, a boat or
two lying on the shore, and a few appropriate figures; remove the
ship in the fore-ground to the second distance, with others in
the last distance to mark the horizon, and with these materials,
if well managed, a very pleasing picture may be formed.</p>
<p>But a storm at sea has in itself sufficient grandeur to
support it; the vessel labouring with the sea, having all its
formal lines broken <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>by the disposition of its sails, and which being, as is
often the case, strongly illuminated by the sun bursting through
the gloom, with the whitening surges breaking upon the shoals or
dashing against the sides of the vessel, doubly augmenting the
blackness of the sea and sky, form a contrast so noble as to
render all other aids superfluous.</p>
<p>Sea fowls as having a peculiar character of their own, and
also as tending to mark that of a sea-coast view more strongly,
have always been considered, and with the greatest propriety, as
objects highly picturesque and amusing whether in natural or in
artificial landscape.&nbsp; Mr. Gilpin has treated of them at
large in his Forest Scenery, with that accuracy and elegance
peculiar to himself; nor has another great master done them less
justice.</p>
<p class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;The
cormorant on high<br />
Wheels from the deep and screams along the land;<br />
Loud shrieks the soaring hern; and with wild wing<br />
The circling sea fowl cleave the flaky clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: right" class="poetry">THOMPSON.</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>Most
strangers pay a visit to the light-house, which stands on an
eminence about three quarters of a mile to the eastward of the
town, and commands an extensive sea-view, the inland prospect is
confined by a range of hills forming an amphitheatre around
it.&nbsp; The tower built of brick is only three moderate stories
high, crowned with a lantern lighted by fifteen patent lamps,
each placed in a large copper reflector three feet in diameter
and finely plated on the inside; these placed round an upright
axis are kept in continual motion by jack-work, wound up every
five hours and a half, by which means a set of five reflectors
are presented to the eye in a full blaze of light every minute,
the axis being three minutes in performing its rotation.</p>
<p>The house was formerly lighted up with coals, which was not
only an uncertain light, but also a fixed one and was frequently
mistaken; it was therefore thought necessary to have it upon a
principle differing from any other upon this part of the coast to
prevent such <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>mistakes, the consequences of which might prove so very
fatal.&nbsp; The lamps all the year are lighted up at sun-set and
extinguished at sun-rise; during the longest nights in winter,
the consumption of the best oil each night is three gallons.</p>
<p>It is kept by two young women who receive from the
Trinity-house an annual salary of fifty-pounds, besides
perquisites, and who constantly reside on the spot, which for
perfect neatness may vie with any place.&nbsp; From the lantern a
door opens to a light iron gallery which surrounds it, and
commands a sea view of many leagues.</p>
<p>Extending the walk a little further you get a pleasing view of
the village of Overstrand.&nbsp; Shipping, also, is seen to much
greater advantage above than below the cliffs; and those who are
fond of looking down precipices may find amusement, their
situation being between three and four hundred feet perpendicular
above the level of the sea.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Cromer
Hall, the residence of George Wyndham, Esq. is a respectable old
house; there is nothing in the inside to repay curiosity, but the
sequestered walks in the wood near the house are very
delightful.</p>
<p>These plantations make a very pleasing appearance from many
places; taken in front they are too formal and circumscribed,
notwithstanding which they prove the greatest possible ornament
to the town of Cromer, and in autumn are extremely beautiful.</p>
<h3><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span><i>Section the Second</i>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Going</span> down cliff at low-water the
beach to the north of the jetty presents a very pleasant walk of
a mile and a half to the village of Upper Runton, where ascending
by a path cut through cliffs of a very romantic form, on the edge
of which stand some fishermens&rsquo; cottages, you return to
Cromer by a foot path close to the sea side; the country on the
right is cultivated and interspersed with hills covered with
furze.</p>
<p>Approaching within half a mile, the town with the light-house,
and hills as a background, Mr. G. Wyndham&rsquo;s woods and the
mill make a pretty appearance.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>A
little further on is the Battery, which as it belongs to Cromer
should have been mentioned in the foregoing section.&nbsp; It
occupies a very fine eminence commanding more than a semicircle
and mounts four eighteen pounders, which are exercised by the
Cromer Loyal Volunteer Artillery; being also well supplied with
stores it affords excellent protection to the shipping upon this
part of the coast which bring up under it in cases of
danger.&nbsp; It is but justice to add, also, in many instances
the corps have proved themselves extremely active in giving every
assistance in their power; and by the liberal allowance of powder
and ball, provided by Government, solely for practice, they are
become very expert gunners.</p>
<p>I cannot here omit to mention the almost miraculous escape of
Mr. Richard Cook, a corporal, belonging to the corps, who was
blown from the cannon&rsquo;s mouth while a salute was firing on
the 4th of June, 1799, in honour of his Majesty&rsquo;s
birth-day.&nbsp; The gun at which he was stationed having been
badly spunged, the <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>succeeding cartridge took fire and carried him over the
platform to the very edge of the cliff.&nbsp; This unfortunate
accident happened as he was in the act of withdrawing the rammer,
from the head of which (it being driven into numerous splinters)
he received at least fifty wounds, most of them were very severe;
notwithstanding which I am happy to say, that by the blessing of
a fine constitution, he is at this time perfectly recovered
without suffering even the loss of a finger or being scarcely
blemished.</p>
<h3><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span><i>Section the Third</i>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> Cromer take the Aylmerton
or as it called the upper road to Holt, which is preferable to
the lower road running through Runton, Beeston, and Sherringham,
both because it is in itself better, and because the views of the
sea and country are more amusing.</p>
<p>The distance by either is ten miles.&nbsp; Concluding
therefore that the Aylmerton road is taken, at the distance of
about a mile and half from Cromer are the plantations of the Rt.
Hon. Wm. Wyndham, of Felbrigg, which accompany the traveller on
his left for more than half a mile, during which space the views
of the sea on the right are very pleasing.</p>
<p><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>The
fore-ground being high, the eye is carried down a pretty steep
descent towards the shore, and being also a very unequal surface,
a constant variety is produced, the inequalities forming
themselves into vallies, through which is frequently seen, a
church, a cottage or a village to great advantage.</p>
<p>This is a very common species of landscape.&nbsp; The towns
and villages with their churches situated on the verge of the
coast, must consequently often assume this appearance when seen
from situations more inland, but more particularly, when, as is
here the case, the surface of the country is uneven and sometimes
woody.</p>
<p>It is a very happy circumstance in views of this kind when a
woody knoll presents itself as a fore-ground, this with a church
or village in the second distance, having the whole backed by the
sea, is a composition that can scarcely fail to please.</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>A
little beyond the plantations before mentioned, which form a part
of the belt round Felbrigg Park, the sea is lost for about a
mile, but ample compensation is made by the country on the left
which is very rich and fertile.&nbsp; The Felbrigg woods with the
village of Aylmerton and its church form a noble fore-ground,
beyond which the view extends upwards of twenty miles over a
highly cultivated country; amongst the numerous churches, the
cathedral at Norwich is very conspicuous.</p>
<p>I entirely agree with Mr. Gilpin that a country retiring into
a remote distance is amongst the most pleasing circumstances in
landscape, but when it happens, as it does here, to be supported
by objects near at hand it is enchanting.&nbsp; It is not
unfrequent that a dreary heath is terminated by a very pleasing
distance, and it is certainly a very happy circumstance for the
traveller who views a country with a picturesque eye when it is
so, but it loses much for want of a fore-ground to <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>support it;
sometimes here and there how an accidental group of cattle form a
pleasing substitute.</p>
<p>The most beautiful effect given to a distance I ever saw was
one evening, in my return from Holt, in the month of April.&nbsp;
The forepart of the day had been cold and gloomy with frequent
squalls, but towards the evening the sun broke out at intervals
with the utmost brilliancy, lighting up in succession different
parts of the landscape; the fore-ground was principally in
shadow, as was the second distance, but the remote distance
partook of the colour of the horizon which was a bright yellow,
but kept down by the mistiness of the atmosphere;&mdash;the
utmost keeping was preserved, producing at once the most sober
and yet the most brilliant picture that can possibly be
conceived.&nbsp; The clouds, except those in the western
hemisphere, floated in large dark masses, intermixed with smaller
light ones of the tenderest blue.</p>
<p><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>The
view towards the sea, though, but faintly illuminated, was no
less pleasing, so that three or four pictures, all completely
differing in circumstance and detail, might have been painted
from a scene with little to recommend it, except where the sea
formed a part of the view.</p>
<p>Upon the disposition of the air depends the colouring of the
landscape, of which no part of it partakes so much as the remote
distance, and to this it is that we owe that exquisite obscurity
and tenderness which stamp such value upon a distant
prospect.</p>
<p>The study of nature by the rules of painting is capable of
bestowing other benefits besides what acrue to the arts; it leads
us to inspect every object with the minutest care, and by so
doing learn to appreciate its value.&nbsp; The stump of a decayed
old tree, the formation of a tussuck of grass, or in short,
innumerable things which pass unnoticed by the casual observer,
afford to the lover of nature a <a name="page30"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 30</span>most delicious repast.&nbsp; But,
perhaps, there is nothing that tends more to harmonise the foul
and render it susceptible of the finer feelings, than a distant
view melting into the horizon, tinged with gold and diffusing its
serenity over the face of nature.</p>
<p>The pleasure of such moments, when the heart is filled with
every sentiment of benevolence, is frequently felt but can never
be described: the imagination following, the eye is naturally
carried to that part of the horizon which invelopes the
habitation of those we admire and esteem; it takes its seat by
the social fire-side or its place in the friendly evening&rsquo;s
ramble, it recalls past scenes of happiness, the amusements and
the friendships of our youth and paints them with a force
inimitable: in short such an unbounded scope is there allowed for
the illusions of fancy, that I am not altogether certain but that
such ideal enjoyments are more than equal to the majority of real
ones which are anticipated with so much ardour.&nbsp; However if
they do not <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>exceed or equal, they must at least be allowed to
approach very near them; and I am inclined to think that the
number of those is not small who will concur with me in this
opinion.</p>
<p>Proceeding forward the sea again makes its appearance upon the
right, and continues a most delightful companion till you come
within three miles of Holt; the remaining part of the way is over
a heath rather dreary and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Holt is a neat little town, with a market on Saturdays; there
is an excellent free grammar school, founded by Sir John Gresham,
with a salary paid to the master by the Fishmonger&rsquo;s
Company.</p>
<p>The return from Holt may be agreeably varied by taking the
lower road, and by which a very romantic view is obtained at
Sherringham Hill.&nbsp; About two miles from hence are the ruins
of Beeston Priory, the property <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>of Cremer Woodrow, Esq. which will
afford pleasure both to the antiquarian and the draftsman.&nbsp;
A small tower and the whole of the west gable wall of the church
are standing, and having its other parts well broken, of which a
great deal remains, form a very antique and handsome ruin.&nbsp;
It also affords ample materials for an admirable sketch from the
west gable, through which the tower and the internal parts of the
church are seen in excellent perspective.&nbsp; Its aspect too
gives it every advantage it can possibly receive from the vivid
illumination of an evening sun.</p>
<p>This gable, one of the finest and most picturesque parts of
the ruin, a few years since was ornamented with a profusion of
the finest ivy, (probably the growth of a century) till
unfortunately a thoughtless wight, employed on the spot, laid his
sacrilegious axe to the root of this venerable appendage, to the
great regret of the proprietor and of every admirer of the
reliques of antiquity.</p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>The
house to which it belongs, with the barn, stables and farm yard,
have been injudiciously placed close under the walls of the
Priory, in fact some small part of the ruins are converted into
outhouses.&nbsp; Had they been suffered to stand by themselves
the effect would have been much better&mdash;a ruin can scarcely
be too much sequestered or too distant from the haunts of men. <a
name="citation33"></a><a href="#footnote33"
class="citation">[33]</a></p>
<p>Beeston Priory was founded by the Lady Isabel de Cressy, in
the reign of King John, for Canons of the Order of Saint Austin
and dedicated to Saint Mary.</p>
<p>Not far from the Priory, on the right hand, is a house
belonging to Cremer Cremer, Esq. <a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>where instead of keeping the direct
road to Cromer, take in at the white gate leading past the
house.&nbsp; The road winds in a very romantic manner between the
hills unto Felbrigg Heath, upon which are the remains of a
beacon;&mdash;the view from this spot is not altogether so
extensive as from the beacon at Trimmingham, but it is more
diversified.</p>
<p>The foreground is rough and well broken and the dreariness of
the heath removed by the little patches of forest wood with which
the vallies are adorned.&nbsp; Cromer with its light-house and
lofty tower, Runton, Beeston Priory and Sherringham, and as far
as Blackney Harbour, the whole being backed by the sea, form as
fine a coast view as can well be imagined.</p>
<p>The same tract which led to the beacon, about half a mile
further on, opens into the Cromer road, under the plantations
which were passed in going to Holt and from which the whole
retrospect is very pleasing.</p>
<h3><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span><i>Section the Fourth</i>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Felbrigg</span>, the seat of the Right
Honourable William Windham, makes a very pleasant morning&rsquo;s
excursion; it is three short miles from Cromer, delightfully
situated in the bosom of extensive and venerable woods.&nbsp; The
oak, the beech and the spanish chesnut, seem congenial to the
soil; and the form of the ground, which consists of gently rising
hills and vales, is admirably constituted to shew to the greatest
advantage the masses of light and shade produced by such a
combination.</p>
<p>Some of the trees, particularly the oak, bear the marks of
great antiquity, and the venerable state of decay into which they
are <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>fallen, make them truly interesting objects and the
ornament of the scene to which they belong.</p>
<p>The oak stands, indisputably, the unrivalled king of the
vegetable tribe&mdash;strength joined to the most perfect beauty
are its distinguishing characteristics; <a
name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a> it fills every situation with dignity
and equally adorns the castle or the cottage; but it is when time
has placed <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>its honours on its head, when its</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;boughs
are mossed with age,<br />
And high top bald with dry antiquity,&rdquo;</p>
<p>and it is approaching by slow but sure gradation to the period
of a glorious existence, that it becomes an object of the
greatest beauty, presenting to the lover of nature an ample scope
of amusement.</p>
<p>The house has of late undergone considerable alteration, and
when finished will be both elegant and convenient.&nbsp; It
contains some good pictures by Rembrandt, Bergham, Vanderveldt,
&amp;c.</p>
<p>The dining-room is decorated with good portraits of the
Windham family.</p>
<p>In the drawing-room are several pictures; a Usurer by
Rembrandt, and the portrait of an Old Woman by the same master,
supposed to be his Mother, deserve particular attention; <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>the latter is
placed over the door by which you enter the room but hangs too
high.&nbsp; There are, also, some good representations of
Sea-Fights; one in particular a pretty large picture, by
Vanderveldt, Jun. is a very spirited performance; the effect of
the smoke, from the vessels in the foreground, which is made to
receive the light, is very masterly; the subject is the
Engagement between the English and Van Tromp, in which Sir Edward
Spragge was killed.&nbsp; Its companion by the elder Vanderveldt,
is, also, a Sea-Fight, but a confused and wholly uninteresting
performance.&nbsp; Over each of these pieces, is a Storm, by
Vanderveldt, Jun. in his usual stile of excellence.</p>
<p>At the other end of the room are two very fine Views of the
River Thames, one at Billinsgate Market, the other before the
alteration at London Bridge;&mdash;over one of these pictures is
a Landscape by Bergham, and over the other a small but highly
coloured picture, the Finding of Achilles at the Court of
Lycomedes, said to be by Reubens.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>From
the drawing-room you proceed to the cabinet.&nbsp; The small
pictures are by much the best; two or three Storms, by
Vanderveldt, jun. in his best manner; Cows Stalled, by Sagtleven,
Scheveling Market, and a small Landscape, by Paul Brill, are
excellent; the trees of the latter are very finely touched.</p>
<p>Some of the larger pictures are very good, particularly two
Views, by G. B. H. Bus&ugrave;ri,&mdash;one of which is the
Cascade of Terni.</p>
<p>The rest of the collection in this room is chiefly composed of
Italian Landscapes, and small Views of Italian Ruins in opaque
colours.</p>
<p>One of the best pictures in the house is at present set aside;
it is an Italian Sea-Port in a Hazy Morning, every part of which
is delicately expressed.</p>
<p>The pictures above stairs are of little worth, neither is
there much else to attract the attention, except the library,
which is fitted up <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>with much gothic elegance and admirably corresponding
with the old stile of building of the south front.&nbsp; The
gloom thrown into the room by the stained-glass windows and the
sombre hue of the wainscot, which is of its natural colour, make
it a very proper retirement for study.</p>
<p>Two miles from Felbrigg stand the ruins of Beckham Old Church,
which for its size is one of the most elegant things which fancy
can imagine.&nbsp; The walls of the middle aisle and the chancel
are standing, and, also, the south porch.&nbsp; Beautiful
fragments of the old gothic windows, in different states of
decay, are seen peeping through the ivy, which mantles in the
most luxuriant manner over almost the whole of its mouldering
walls.</p>
<p>It is rendered still more delicious by the sequestered spot in
which it stands; there is but one house near it and that at such
a distance as not to interfere with the loneliness of its
situation; and though it must have been <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>long, very
long since its choir has rung responsive to the notes of the
parish clerk, joined by the simple rustic swains, raised to the
praise of their Creator, its little cemetery covered with turf
remains the sacred repository of the dead, many of whose peaceful
ashes lie shaded by the long arms of several venerable
oaks.&nbsp; Here</p>
<p style="text-align: center" class="poetry">&ldquo;The mopeing
owl does to the moon complain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Change the elms of Mr. Gray to oaks and his elegant poem
exactly applies to Beckham Church Yard. <a
name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a></p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Beneath these rugged elms, that
yew-tree&rsquo;s shade,<br />
Where heaves the turf in many a mould&rsquo;ring heap,<br />
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,<br />
The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>To a
mind fond of retirement, the lonely ruin covered with ivy, the
cottage or the grove have infinite charms; they seem to be a
refuge from the storms of life and to have the power of soothing
the mind, disordered by discordant passions, to serenity and
peace.</p>
<p>The imagination at liberty to enjoy its own reflections,
revolves its misfortunes, draws conclusions and compares the
present with the past, and is inspired by the situation with that
kind of pleasing awe that bids him look forward to brighter
prospects.</p>
<h3><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span><i>Section the Fifth</i>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Ruins of the parochial Church
at Thorp-Market having been lately taken down and rebuilt in a
peculiar stile, by the Right Honourable Lord Suffield, the
impropriator, attracts many spectators from its novelty.</p>
<p>The present structure, which was designed by Mr. Wood, is
simple and elegant; the materials are flint and free-stone, at
each of the four corners is a turret, and the points of the
gables are terminated by a stone cross after the monkish
fashion.</p>
<p>The inside, consisting of only a single aisle, is finished
with extreme neatness and in parts with a considerable degree of
taste.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>The
chancel is divided from the body of the church by a light gothic
wainscot screen, and an equal portion of the west end by a
similar one.&nbsp; The upper parts of each are decorated with
modern glass paintings; the subject of those at the chancel end
are, in the center, the Dove sent forth from the Ark, and on each
side Moses and Aaron.&nbsp; In the center of the corresponding
screen are the King&rsquo;s Arms, well painted upon copper, and
on each side those of his Lordship&rsquo;s family in painted
glass.</p>
<p>The pulpit is placed against the north wall and is entered
from a staircase in the vestry, on each side is a door, over
which are painted, in imitation of bass relief, the symbolical
figures of the Saints Mark and Luke.</p>
<p>The greatest defect in the building is in the disposition of
the stained-glass in the windows, which instead of being
concentrated in such a manner as to throw that devotional gloom
into the church which produces such <a name="page45"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 45</span>an evident effect upon the mind, and
which appears to me to have been the original intention of
stained or painted glass, is scattered over the whole window in
small pieces, greens, purples, reds and yellows, regularly
intermixed with white, giving to the whole an appearance of too
much gaiety, independent of the unpleasant manner in which, in a
day when the sun is bright, the different colours of the glass
are reflected over the church and upon the persons of the
congregation. <a name="citation45"></a><a href="#footnote45"
class="citation">[45]</a></p>
<p>There are three family monuments taken from the walls of the
old church.&nbsp; Another small but very elegant one has been
added, in memory of Robert and William Morden, <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>second and
fourth sons of the late Sir William Morden Harbord, Baronet, and
brothers to the present Lord Suffield.</p>
<p>This monument was executed by C. Rynart.</p>
<p>As in all human efforts there will be some defects, so it
happens that Thorp Church is not entirely free; but what few
there are, are so well counterbalanced by its beauties, which are
numerous, that it cannot fail to be in a high degree worthy the
attention of the curious.</p>
<p>This church, with Gunton Hall, the seat of his Lordship, may
be conveniently inspected in a ride from Cromer to
North-Walsham.</p>
<p>The house is by no means equal to the ideas we may be led to
form of it from the plantations which surround it.&nbsp; It is,
however, pleasantly situated upon an eminence which overlooks an
extensive sweep of the park towards the south.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>The
description of the house, offices, and Gunton Church, which stand
but a small distance from each other, I shall quote from the
History of Norfolk, having myself never seen more than the
outside, it not being, I believe, publicly shown.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Gunton Hall, the seat of Sir Harbord
Harbord, is at present a small house but is going to be enlarged
and has lately been ornamented with new offices, under the
direction of Mr. Wyatt.&nbsp; They are by far the most complete
buildings for the purpose of any thing in this kingdom; the new
stile of architecture is by its lightness and extreme elegance
well adapted to offices, and these are particularly worthy the
attention of strangers, from the studied contrivance for
conveniency in the apartments, as, also, for the slate covering,
which consists of small square pieces of slate, each fastened by
wood skrews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not far from the house is the parish church which by
the late Sir William Harbord was <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>taken down and rebuilt, with a
magnificent portico of the Doric order; this receives an
additional degree of sanctity from two venerable druidical oaks
which grace the front of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>North-Walsham is situated about three miles from Gunton, it is
a dull, unpleasant town with a market on Thursdays, a turnpike
road has lately been established from this town to Norwich, from
which it is distant fourteen miles.</p>
<p>Two miles from Gunton is Hanworth, the seat of Robert Lee
Doughty, Esq. an excellent modern house, situated in a small but
very pleasant park, well wooded and laid out with taste; a farm
house and the parish church which stands on an eminence, both in
the park, are very pretty objects as seen from the road.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ride from Cromer to Mundesley
will present the traveller with some pleasing scenes; the road
runs almost entirely along the coast, taking in its course the
villages of Overstrand, Syderstrand and Trimmingham.&nbsp; On a
hill, about a mile through the latter village, stand the ruins of
an old beacon, which commands a noble prospect both of the sea
and land; in very clear weather Yarmouth is discoverable, and the
cathedral spire at Norwich very plainly to be seen.&nbsp; Few,
who pay a visit to Cromer, omit seeing this view, which is,
perhaps, the most extensive in the county of Norfolk.</p>
<p>About two miles further on is Mundesley, a straggling village,
little worthy of notice.&nbsp; <a name="page50"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 50</span>There is one bathing machine, and
some few, though the number is very small, frequent Mundesley in
the bathing season.&nbsp; The accommodations are very confined,
four or five houses at the utmost appear at all calculated for
the purposes of lodgings, and those are situated close to the
side of a dusty road.</p>
<p>The beach seems to be equally as good for bathing as at
Cromer, and the walking much the same, the tide at low water
leaving a fine firm land.</p>
<p>The prospect upon the beach to the southward differs in
appearance from Cromer, by the land at Happisburgh jutting into
the sea, forming a promontory, which with the church and the two
light-houses has a good effect.</p>
<p>Every one who has made a study of nature is well aware of the
different appearance of the same spot as it is affected by the
times of the day and the changes of the weather; so much so,
indeed, that it not unfrequently happens <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>that the
whole beauty of a view depends upon such accidental causes.&nbsp;
This was the case with the promontory at my first seeing it; the
clouds at its back were dark and heavy, opposed by a bright
sun-shine from the west, giving it a strong opposition of light
and shadow, which being harmonized by the fine purple tint with
which it was overspread, rendered it a very pleasing object.</p>
<p>In a few moments, the sun declining behind a cloud, the beauty
of the prospect vanished, and a heavy mass of apparently
shapeless earth was left to the view; and even of that the
outline was almost obliterated by the cloud descending over it in
a hasty shower.</p>
<p>Excellent effects of light and shadow are sometimes produced
even in a dull gloomy day when the sun makes an attempt to break
from his obscurity; the clouds in that part becoming brilliant,
their light is strongly reflected upon distant objects.</p>
<p><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>Sea
views are particularly adapted, when well adorned with shipping,
to give full effect to such partial lights; you will at such
times, perhaps, see the vessels on the fore-ground in deep
shadow, and those in the second distance strongly illuminated,
while those in the last distance shall be invested with a grey or
purple tint.&nbsp; These are called the accidents <a
name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a> of painting, and the artist cannot be
too careful in his observations upon these effects, as he must
entirely depend upon his memory <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>for producing them on canvass, which
from continually changing will seldom allow him to fix them on
the spot.</p>
<p>It is a very common method in sketching a landscape (and where
dispatch is required by much the most ready) to make a mere
outline and to strengthen the memory by written references; and
it is certainly an excellent one when the shadow of objects are
in some degree permanent, but in the present instance they are so
momentary and fleeting that before an outline could be sketched
the very shadows which gave a value to the landscape would be
lost.</p>
<p>It frequently happens that a spot without one beauty in itself
acquire so much, under the influence of these partial lights, as
to appear the &ldquo;thing it is not.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
appearances however, are often very beautiful, but it is to be
regretted that like all other borrowed ornaments they only serve
when laid aside to render the defects of the wearer the more
conspicuous.</p>
<h3><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span><i>Section the Seventh</i>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Cottage at Northrepps or as it
is some times called the Hermitage, the country residence of
Bartlett Gurney, Esq. might have been included in the excursion
to Mundesley, but as it is within a walk of Cromer, being only
distant about a mile and half, it will be doing no more than
justice to the beauties of the place to give it a section by
itself.</p>
<p>The house which is flinted and thatched, with a gothic porch
also thatched, is fitted up with the greatest neatness and
simplicity, and the stained-glass which occupies the upper parts
of the arches of the windows throws a very pleasing light into
the apartments.&nbsp; The parlour which commands an elegant view
of <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>the
sea, is decorated with coloured prints, extremely appropriate to
the situation; such as the sailor-boy&rsquo;s return, the
ship-wrecked sailor-boy telling his tale at a cottage door,
&amp;c. on the chimney-piece are shells and pieces of polished
lava.</p>
<p>The situation is very romantic in a deep narrow valley,
through which is seen the little Church of Overstrand, partly in
ruins, and beyond it the sea.&nbsp; The views from different
parts of the estate are many of them beautiful and even in the
present barren state of the hills are well adapted to the
pencil.&nbsp; Overstrand Church and the sea, as seen from the
Northrepps road, is a view which comes into excellent
composition; fortunately there are in that spot a few trees of
sufficient consequence to divest it of nakedness and give it
beauty.&nbsp; Indeed, time only is wanting to make this estate as
elegant a situation as can be desired.</p>
<p>Planting has been done with a liberal hand and the healthy
appearance of the young trees, <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>when the situation so near the sea is
considered, promises, hereafter, amply to reward the owner for
his perseverance.</p>
<p>The difficulty of raising trees where there two such enemies
as the cutting winds from the sea and a numerous breed of
rabbits, deters the proprietors of estates from planning the
number of hills which at present lay waste; there is, also,
another unfortunate circumstance that attends planting, which is
the slow growth of timber.&nbsp; The first expence is
considerable and there is certainly some hazard, particularly
where there are such enemies as before-mentioned, but if it was
attended to with care, there is no doubt, but in time, it would
much more than repay the cost.</p>
<p>It is true, that the profits to the present possessor of an
estate are not very great.&nbsp; He seldom begins to plant till
half his life is spent, but admitting that he begins at the age
of thirty or forty, and chuses to sell his estate at fifty or
sixty, the growth of twenty or thirty <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>thirty years, even if it was little
better than underwood, would certainly considerably augment its
value, betides the improvement on the score of picturesque
beauty, which is by no means inconsiderable and not to be
overlooked.</p>
<p>On a hill called Toll&rsquo;s-Hill, not far from the house, is
a very fine echo.&nbsp; This spot, literally speaking, is only a
small portion of a range of hills running towards Syderstrand;
they command at all points a good view of the sea, and in
particular parts come into very decent composition.&nbsp; By
descending into the vallies, the hills are brought to fold over
each other, and the land between them and the sea, which forms
the second distance, being interspersed with cottages and a few
trees, (though the latter are scarce articles so near the sea)
renders the situation in many parts very picturesque.</p>
<p>These hills are situated a small distance out of the beaten
track, but the lover of nature in order to see her to the
greatest <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>advantage must often deviate from the high road, where
indeed he will seldom see her to his taste; not but a high road,
under some circumstances, has the power of affording much
amusement and of making an excellent picture, but, generally
speaking, beautiful nature like humble modesty, retires from the
general gaze and must be sought for in seclusion.</p>
<h3><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span><i>Section the Eighth</i>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Blickling</span>, late the seat of the
Earl of Buckinghamshire, but now of the Honourable Asheton
Harbord, must from its external appearance command the attention
of the passing traveller, as also from its having been the birth
place of a Queen of England, Anne Bulleyn wife of Henry the
Eighth.&nbsp; It is a noble old building in the gothic taste,
having a square turret at each corner and one more lofty in the
center with a cupola and clock.&nbsp; The entrance from the court
yard (on each side of which are ranged the offices in the same
stile of building with the house) is over a bridge, of two
arches, across the moat, through a gate house and small inner
court, and is very striking in its appearance; from <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>this you
enter the hall 42ft by 33ft and 33ft in height.&nbsp; The
staircase, which is ornamented with small figures carved in wood,
branches off to the right and left having a gallery of
communication at the top, where are full length statues of Anne
Bulleyn and Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>From the hall you proceed to the anti-room 22ft square, where
are portraits of Sir John Hobart, Sir Henry Hobart, Sir Robert
Rich, Sir William Lemon, General Cope and Sir John Maynard.&nbsp;
The portrait of Sir John Hobart is exceedingly fine, that of Sir
Henry is striking as it brings to our memory his unfortunate
death, occasioned by a duel with Mr. Le Neve, upon Cawston Heath,
where a square monumental stone marks the spot where the event
took place.</p>
<p>The portrait of Sir Robert Rich is singular by a black patch
over one of the eyes.&nbsp; From this you proceed to the dining
room, over the chimney piece of which are the arms <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>of the family
well carved with this motto</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><i>Qua supra Anno
Do</i>. 1627.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lady Buckingham&rsquo;s dressing room is adorned with prints;
adjoining to it is Lord Buckingham&rsquo;s bed room in which is a
double size chintz bed with a curtain falling down in the
center.&nbsp; This bed is placed in an alcove, supported by four
pillars.</p>
<h4>THE STUDY,</h4>
<p>33ft by 21ft is a charming room, entirely calculated for
comfort, being furnished with a selection of the best authors,
some excellent drawings and a piano forte; out of this apartment
is the</p>
<h4>ORGAN ROOM,</h4>
<p>in which is a carved chimney piece rather curious; from this
room you again enter the hall and proceed upstairs to the
tapestry <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>room.&nbsp; The tapestry from which it takes its name
does not appear to be remarkably fine.&nbsp; The next apartment
is the</p>
<h4>OLD DINING ROOM,</h4>
<p>on each side the fire-place are portraits at full of the
present King and Queen, by Sir Joshua Reynolds.&nbsp; The late
Lord Townshend, Sir Charles Brighthead, the Countess of Suffolk,
the Earl of Leicester and Sir Robert Walpole.&nbsp; In this room
is the chair of state, in which James the second sat when at
Dublin, it was given to the late Lord Buckingham when at
Clanbrassil, in 1792.&nbsp; To look at this chair, which by the
bye, certainly conveys an idea of state in poverty, one can
scarcely suppress a smile; it is made, I believe, of no better
materials than wainscot, covered with a common crimson stuff, and
so high that unless James had been possessed of the legs of an
O&rsquo;Brien, it is utterly impossible they should ever have
reached the floor.&nbsp; From this room you pass through two
dressing rooms the latter is Lady <a name="page63"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Caroline&rsquo;s, adorned with
prints, from which you proceed to the</p>
<h4>NEW DRAWING ROOM,</h4>
<p>42ft by 25ft and 22ft in height; it is hung with pink sattin,
the ceiling stucco, richly but lightly ornamented, having the
four corner compartments with that in the middle (from which is
suspended a beautiful glass chandelier) stained with a delicate
pink which has good effect; and harmonizes well with the other
parts of the room.&nbsp; One end of this charming apartment is
adorned with a figure in tapestry, as large as life, of the Czar
Peter, whose attitude with that of the horse is excessively
spirited and fine; the back-ground to this noble performance,
which is said to be needle-work, represents all the confusion of
a battle, which the Czar is supposed to be directing, he is
without a hat, his hair is black and bushy and his eyes which are
black and uncommonly piercing, added to a well-turned head, have
given all that fire and animation <a name="page64"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 64</span>to his countenance which his
situation would seem to call forth.&nbsp; This superb ornament
was given to the late Lord Buckingham by the Empress of
Russia.</p>
<p>At the other end, of the same size, is a very fine painting of
George the Second, also, on horse-back.&nbsp; On each side the
fire-place are whole length portraits, of Lord and Lady
Buckingham, by Gainsborough.&nbsp; The chimney piece is very
fine.&nbsp; Adjoining this room is the</p>
<h4>STATE BED CHAMBER,</h4>
<p>33ft by 21ft which is fitted-up upon an equal scale of
magnificence; the bed which is of crimson damask, ornamented at
the head with the arms of the royal family, is placed under an
alcove, supported by four fluted pillars of white and gold,
corresponding with the other parts of the room, which is hung
with white tabby, the mouldings, cornice, ceiling, &amp;c. richly
ornamented with gilding.</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>Under a
very splendid looking-glass stands a beautiful marble table, on a
gilt frame, and over the chimney-piece (which is unfortunately
not in a good situation) is an exceeding fine portrait of Judge
Hobart, in his robes; this, with the portrait of Sir John Hobart
before mentioned, I think carries every appearance of having been
executed by Holbein.</p>
<p>From these two truly beautiful apartments, you are carried to
the library, which does not in my opinion answer the ideas which
we are led to form from its general character.&nbsp; Its length,
which is 125ft, when compared with its breadth, which is only
22ft, renders it merely a strip; it is, however, well calculated
for a dancing-room, to which purpose, I believe, it has been
chiefly applied.&nbsp; The ceiling is stucco, divided into five
compartments, which are relieved with emblematical figures of the
five senses.</p>
<p>Having particularized the principal things within, you proceed
to the park, which is very extensive and profusely adorned with
<a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>wood.&nbsp; It has the advantage, also, of a fine piece
of water, nearly a mile in length and in its broadest part four
hundred yards; the northern bank is richly fringed with wood,
from which you view the opposite side of the lawn, which rises
gradually for a considerable space, broken at intervals by large
plantations of oak and beach.&nbsp; A banqueting room, to which
is attached a tower commanding an extensive prospect, terminates
the view very agreeably.</p>
<p>About a mile from the house stands the mausoleum, a freestone
building in the form of a pyramid, in which are deposited the
remains of the late Lord Buckingham and his first lady.&nbsp; Its
situation is very happily chosen in the midst of a large and
venerable wood, whose solitude appears only to be broken by the
prying curiosity of the stranger or the foot-steps of the nimble
deer.</p>
<p>In the church, which stands very near the house and contiguous
to the public road from <a name="page67"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Aylsham to Holt, are many
inscriptions and effigies in brass, some few monuments and a
handsome tomb of the Clere&rsquo;s and the Boleyn&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
In a vault, under the north aisle, are deposited nineteen of the
relations and ancestors of the late Earl of Buckingham, amongst
whom are his father and mother, with the Honourable Henry Hobart
before mentioned; the coffins are placed in upright positions and
most of them covered with black or crimson velvet.&nbsp; The late
Lady Buckingham was interred in a vault in the chancel, but upon
the death of her lord her remains were taken up and conveyed to
the mausoleum.</p>
<p>Blickling is distant but a mile and a half from Aylsham, a
neat market-town, with an excellent neighbourhood; it is situated
on the river Bure, which is navigable to Yarmouth, for boats of
thirteen tons burthen; its distance from Norwich, over a turnpike
road, is, eleven miles, and the same from Cromer and Holt.</p>
<p>The road from Aylsham to Cromer is very <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>pleasing, the
country all the way rich, woody and fertile.&nbsp; In Erpingham
field the views are extremely pleasing, and within a mile of
Cromer the road is highly picturesque, it winds through a hollow
way well ornamented with trees, whose long arms meeting across
the road frequently form themselves into arches, through which
the sea breaks in at intervals with the finest effect.</p>
<p>A lane often presents the painter with admirable studies for
foregrounds, they are, more generally than any other parts of
nature, set off with rugged old pollards, stretching their long
arms athwart the road, their furrowed trunks and twilled branches
being enriched with stains and mosses of all hues, from the light
grey and brilliant yellow to the dark green approaching to
black.&nbsp; The bank it shelters at the same time, affording a
cool retreat to the cow, the sheep and the ass, any of which are
highly picturesque; and the relief given to them, particularly if
the bank is rather steep and broken, by the richness of the soil,
which <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>is,
also, sometimes hollowed into little recesses overhung with moss,
roots and trailing plants, is beyond conception.&nbsp; With
materials as simple as these does Morland produce the most
enchanting effect; indeed, we are always inclined to be pleased
with a performance in proportion as it approaches nature,
provided the objects are well selected.&nbsp; Morland&rsquo;s
pictures are her very counterpart, they possess so much character
and are handled with such spirit, that it is impossible for the
spectator, fond of rural scenes, to examine them without feeling
the most lively interest in the subject.</p>
<p>The opposition between the foliage of young and old trees, the
colouring of their barks and the ramification of their boughs,
are circumstances of great picturesque effect.&nbsp; A beautiful
young ash, for instance, never appears to greater advantage than
when, tinged with the autumnal frosts, it is opposed to the dark
green foliage of the venerable oak, from whose robust form it
seems to implore protection; heightened by contrast, the beauties
<a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>of each
are set forth in the strongest point of view, and afford an
instance where the greatest opposition, both in form and colour,
are exhibited in nature, and may be equally so in a picture,
without in the smallest degree violating the principles of
harmony.</p>
<p>Figures in a road are another great source of amusement, and
whether in motion or at rest, are equally pleasing; they create
an interest in the mind by being strongly contrasted with
inanimate objects.&nbsp; If at some distance, we are naturally
led to enquire who they may be or what their employment; and if a
single figure happens to be reclining upon the bank or leaning
upon his staff, we probably form in our imagination the subject
of his thoughts.</p>
<p>The devious and irregular windings of a lane, well stored with
such picturesque appendages, keep up a continual expectation;
something new opens at every step, the form of every object is
varied, the lights and shadows, also, are varied in the same
proportion; <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>sometimes through a fortunate opening in the fence a
cottage displays its humble roof; at other times a rich distance
bursts upon the view, receiving a double charm from its
unexpected appearance.</p>
<p>Such accidental circumstances give the lane a considerable
advantage over the more extended prospect, to obtain which it is
perhaps necessary to travel over many miles of uninteresting
country.</p>
<h3><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span><i>Section the Ninth</i>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Woolterton</span>, the seat of the Right
Honourable Lord Walpole, is an elegant, modern built, mansion,
situated in a large park, well ornamented with wood and water,
but too flat to be possessed of very great beauty.&nbsp; At a
short distance from the house, is a ruin highly picturesque, the
tower of a church, of which no part else remains; it is a
beautiful small fragment, but appears to be too much skreened by
the ordinary fir trees with which it is encompassed, and which
seem worse than they really are, by being every where surrounded
with fine timber.</p>
<p><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>The
house is said to be ornamented with a considerable quantity of
tapestry, of superior excellence, particularly some chairs, upon
the seats of which are exhibited the fables of &AElig;sop.</p>
<p>I have never seen the inside of Woolterton, and, indeed, of
the park I am qualified to say but little, having surveyed it in
a very casual way; but from what I have seen and from the report
of others, it appears to be a residence worthy of its noble
owner, who generally resides on the spot, and whose private
character is highly estimable.</p>
<h3><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span><i>Section the Tenth</i>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> returning from Holt to Cromer,
the traveller is merely brought through Upper Sherringham, which
is distanced something more than a mile from that which is
denominated Lower Sherringham, situated upon the edge of the
cliff.</p>
<p>So miserable are both these places in themselves, that they
could hardly be supposed to contain any thing worth the
attention, but as it frequently happens that those things which
at first so much disgusted, afterwards upon a familiar
acquaintance, put on a more favourable appearance, and in the end
become objects of delight, I flatter myself that if the villages
of Upper and Lower Sherringham are so unfortunate as to be
incapable of claiming attention, <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>their environs, in point of scenery,
will amply make up the deficiency.</p>
<p>Passing through Upper Sherringham from Cromer, leaving the
Holt road on the left, the traveller is carried past the house of
Cooke Flower, Esq. the proprietor of the beautiful estate which
affords the materials that serve to compose this section.&nbsp;
The situation of which is by no means a letter of recommendation
to the scenes he is approaching.&nbsp; It is not the house but
the grounds about it that demand attention, therefore it is to be
hoped that his disappointment, if symptoms of that kind are
excited, will vanish as he proceeds.</p>
<p>This estate, properly speaking, comes under the denomination
of an adorned farm, by which declaration, I have to request that
my readers will not be alarmed by the fear of being led through a
succession of scenes too frequently disgusting, by an
ostentatious display of trifling puerilities; the nicest taste
will not be offended, yet it is adorned, but it is adorned after
nature&rsquo;s model.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Like
the rest of this part of the Norfolk coast, it consists of uneven
ground rising into bold swells, which by the assiduity and
perseverance of the late Mr. Flower are now richly clothed with
wood from their summits to their base, and united by the most
elegant slopes to the rich vallies that divide them.</p>
<p>Some of these woods appear thick and impenetrable, while
others more open discover through their foliage the most
luxuriant and inviting turf, tempting the traveller oppressed
with the heat of a summer&rsquo;s sultry sun, to exclaim in the
language of <span class="smcap">Thompson</span></p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Still let me pierce into the midnight
depth<br />
Of yonder grove, of wildest largest growth;<br />
That, forming high in air a wood land quire,<br />
Nods o&rsquo;er the mount beneath.&nbsp; At every step,<br />
Solemn and flow, the shadows blacker fall,<br />
And all is awful listening gloom around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among these truly sylvan scenes the sea unfolds its ample
bosom; under every circumstance of variation it is an object of
awful <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>grandeur; but, perhaps, in its more peaceful moments,
when its surface is unruffled by the wind, it is best adapted to
scenes like these, where all is harmony and repose.</p>
<p>Here too, at certain seasons of the year, the flock roams at
large; the wood, the hill, and the valley, are alike subject to
the impression of its wandering feet, and scattered in groupes
over the landscape add greatly to its beauty.</p>
<p>The picturesque figure of the shepherd attended by his dog,
the faithful companion of his solitary hours, in whatever
situation we find him, whether collecting his scattered flock or
indolently stretched at ease upon the verdant turf, are
circumstances of the most pleasing kind.</p>
<p
class="poetry">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Amid
his subjects safe,<br />
Slumbers the monarch-swain, his careless arm<br />
Thrown round his head, on downy moss sustain&rsquo;d;<br />
Here laid his scrip, with wholesome viands fill&rsquo;d;<br />
There, lift&rsquo;ning every noise, his watchful dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>Neither
must we forget the rural situation of the shepherd&rsquo;s
cottage; this subject has often been the theme of authors, both
in fiction and reality; here happily it has in reality the very
situation we should wish it to enjoy, sunk in the bosom of its
wood crowned hills, it appears though a lowly cot, the very
mansion of peace.</p>
<p>By this description, I do not mean the cottage placed by the
hand of art, and made merely to suit the situation, but the real
residence of humble industry, solely for use, not ornamented, and
which time has naturalized to the soil it occupies.&nbsp; This
gives it double value; its moss-grown thatch and time-stained
walls are both in colour and form in perfect harmony with the
objects that surround it, and, the knowledge that it is really
the habitation of the peasant, though we see not its inhabitants
is congenial with our feelings, and aid the delusions which such
scenes impress upon the senses.&nbsp; Connexion of objects which
ought to be the prevailing principle in <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>every kind of
decoration, is too often the last circumstance that is attended
to; by connexion I mean that objects ought to be adapted to the
situation they are intended to occupy, both in form and colour;
and this principle holds good almost in an equal degree in the
internal parts of a house, as in those decorations which are
employed about the pleasure grounds.</p>
<p>In painting it is a general rule that no invention, drawing or
execution, can make amends for want of harmony; a single
predominant colour out of place destroys the effect of a
picture.&nbsp; It is the same in a real landscape, any object out
of place, or that does not connect with the scene, or even
admitting that it is well situated if its construction be
disagreeable, or what is worse its colour, it becomes offensive,
it fixes the attention to the spot and disgusts in proportion as
it has the power of obtruding itself on the view.</p>
<p>The approach from hence to Weybourn, another village upon the
sea coast, is highly picturesque.&nbsp; An ancient ruin of part
of the <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>monastic church, adjoining the parish church, from its
peculiar stile of building may be worth the attention of the
curious in the researches of antiquity, though it is capable of
affording but little to the sketch book of the artist.</p>
<p>From Weybourn instead of returning to Cromer by the same road,
the traveller will keep along the edge of the sea coast, having
on his right hand the woods which he had before passed
between.</p>
<p>By this route he is carried to Lower Sherringham, where there
is a good house of entertainment, with rooms so delightfully
situated, that at high water you may actually conceive yourself
at sea; indeed, there is scarcely a foot path left between the
house and the cliff, and no little care has been taken to exclude
it from the rude embrace of that boisterous element.</p>
<p>Hither parties are frequently formed for <a
name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>the purpose
of eating lobsters, where they are to be had in the same
perfection as at Cromer.&nbsp; A small share of that variety is
also furnished for which human nature pants so eagerly.</p>
<p>The beach spreads before its wanderers the same inviting
surface and the sea as noble an expanse as at Cromer.&nbsp; Here,
too, they may either invoke the Nereides or admire the sublime
and splendid beauties of a summer&rsquo;s sun, setting in the
ocean, a circumstance which Thompson has noticed with exquisite
accuracy and equal elegance.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Low walks the sun, and broadens by
degrees<br />
Just o&rsquo;er the verge of day; the shifting clouds<br />
Assembled gay, a richly gorgeous train,<br />
In all their pomp attend his setting throne.<br />
Air, earth, and ocean, smile immense.&nbsp; And now,<br />
As if his weary chariot fought the bowers<br />
Of Amphitrite and her tending nymphs;<br />

class="footnote">[9]</a>&nbsp; I wish it was in my power to say,
that scenes of this nature always terminated so favourably; but a
most fatal instance happened to the contrary at Cromer, in the
afternoon of the 2nd of February, 1799.&nbsp; About three
o&rsquo;clock a boat with a number of men was seen making toward
the shore&mdash;the surf on the beach was dreadful, and it was
the general opinion that the boat could not live through
it&mdash;and it was but too just!&mdash;for it no sooner came
amongst the breakers than the first sea half filled it, and
another quickly following before it could right, it carried the
boat, in an instant, with its unfortunate crew, to the
bottom.&nbsp; A boat from the shore had before been launched to
give them assistance if possible&mdash;but it was in vain; the
hazard was so imminent that the trial was ineffectual; only two
out of twelve souls escaped; the captain and a poor boy&mdash;the
latter was taken up to all appearance dead and was with great
difficulty recovered.&nbsp; These unfortunate men were Danes,
their vessel laden with timber had struck upon a sand the night
before this melancholy catastrophe, and they had taken to their
boat as a desperate resource to save their lives, which were
almost exhausted for want of sustenance, not having been able to
come at any food from the state of the ship for the two preceding
days.</p>
<p><a name="footnote33"></a><a href="#citation33"

Shenstone) appear to derive their power of pleasing from the
irregularity of surface, which is variety, and the latitude they
afford the imagination to conceive an enlargement of their
dimensions or to recollect any events or circumstances
appertaining to their pristine grandeur.</p>

analogous to that of men.&nbsp; Oaks are in all respects the
perfect image of the manly character.&nbsp; In former times I
should have said, and in present times I think I am authorised to
say, the British one, as a brave man, is not suddenly either
elated by prosperity or depressed by adversity;&mdash;so the oak
displays not its verdure on the sun&rsquo;s first approach nor
drops it on his first departure.&nbsp; Add to this its majestic
appearance, the rough grandeur of its bark and the wide
protection of its branches.</p>
<p>A large branching oak is, perhaps, the most venerable of all
inanimate objects.</p>

<p>This is daily observed in nature and as this newness of

  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
